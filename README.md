**Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify cotton plant health by identifying diseased and fresh leaves and plants. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is designed to assist farmers in timely diagnosing cotton diseases, which is crucial for improving crop yields and managing agricultural resources effectively.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of images categorized into four classes:

Diseased Cotton Leaf
Diseased Cotton Plant
Fresh Cotton Leaf
Fresh Cotton Plant
The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, with respective sizes to ensure the model learns effectively and generalizes well.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: The images are resized and normalized to prepare them for model training.
Model Selection: A pre-trained convolutional neural network (MobileNetV2) is utilized for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.
Training Process: The model is trained with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer. Fine-tuning is applied to improve accuracy further.
Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss on the test dataset, alongside a confusion matrix to visualize classification results.
Results
After training and fine-tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test dataset. This high accuracy indicates that the model can effectively distinguish between diseased and healthy cotton plants and leaves.

**Future Work
Future enhancements could include:**

Expanding the dataset with more images and additional classes for better generalization.
Implementing transfer learning with different architectures.
Developing a web application for farmers to upload images and receive immediate feedback on plant health.
